## The Company

We are Lola Tech, a software development agency that designs and builds digital solutions to help drive organisations forward. Our focus is on delivering scalable and sustainable products for clients across all industries and sectors. We believe in building software for the future - tech that is flexible, strong and built to
last.

The company was created over 10 years ago by Luke in the UK who gathered a few people he had enjoyed working with to deliver a large software project, some of which were living in Romania. Frustrated by the quality of other external vendors he met, he decided to build an awesome agency team he'd actually like to use. Lola Tech was born. Years later we now have 2 offices, one in Cluj-Napoca and a smaller one in London.



## This Handbook

We have written this employee handbook with our core values in mind:

**Pride**: a sense of responsibility for the quality of work and a sense of achievement driving further results and excellence

**Resilience**: The ability to adapt and remain on track long-term, delivering high quality work even when experiencing challenges and difficulties.

**Curiosity**: Having the desire to gain knowledge, information and skill through exploration, investigation and learning.

**Boldness**: Taking action and showing initiative. Assessing and mitigating risks. Thriving in positions of responsibility. The duty to speak out.

**Empathy**: Understanding or feeling what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference; the capacity to place oneself in another's position

Nothing in this handbook should supersede rules and laws of the country where this is read.

## Support

### üï∏Ô∏è The Mesh

The Lola Tech mesh framework is set up to make every staff member feel welcome, supported and encouraged by assigning the following roles:

### [ü§ù Buddies](#-buddies)

The Buddies system at Lola Tech helps new colleagues find their feet swiftly and make new connections. It plays an important role in feeling safe and looked after, and maintaining a happy workplace. #buddies

A buddy provides a friendly face from day one, a place to ask "stupid" questions (spoiler: there aren't any), and helps make joining Lola Tech a great experience.

When someone first joins the company they are assigned a Buddy from the existing pool of volunteers. There's no magic to the selection process here but there's a preference for pairings which cross Team and CoP boundaries but which connect folk at comparable stages in their careers.

After that it is just a matter of following the timeline set out below and keeping to the Buddies Contract:

* Buddies relationship at Lola Tech is reciprocal.
* An initial Buddy partnership is designed to last for one month. We hope after this time you've got to know each other well enough to continue your relationship.
* Both participants agree to make time for the activities and to take action if something interferes.
* Scheduled buddy meetings take precedence over other work activities.
* The Buddy relationship is confidential, a buddy shouldn't pass on anything without explicit consent, nor should either party take any action without prior discussion.

How to be a good buddy - Suggested timeline:

* Before joining:

  * Read your new colleague's CV before they join
  * Have a chat with their interviewer
  * Prepare a welcome message for them in important_all on their first day
  * Check that you'll be working on their first day. Take action if not
* First day:

  * Greet them in important_all first thing in the morning
  * Meet them at the office (if you can) and have a coffee or somesuch, or have a video call with them
  * Make sure you have a slack DM between you so there's an easy open channel
  * Ensure you take them, with anyone else who wants to come, for lunch at your favourite spot. Expense this!
  * Book in a time to chat the next day to discuss anything that's on their mind
* Second day:

  * Have a check in to talk about any questions
  * Make a point of introducing them to two people
* Third day:

  * Book in a short session near the end of their first week. Put it in the calendar. Make it repeat weekly for the next 3 weeks
* End of first week

  * Use the end of week session to focus on practical issues. Commuting, timekeeping, equipment, facilities, expense arrangements etc.
  * Share a favourite tip or trick for making the best of life at Lola Tech
* End of second week

  * Use the end of week session to chat about what you each did at work in the last week
* End of third week

  * Use the end of week session to talk about what still remains mysterious about Lola Tech. Take actions to resolve the mysteries
* End of fourth week

  * Use the end of week session to prepare for a review of the first month with the buddy coordinator (currently Inge)
  * Book Buddy coordinator meeting
* After a month

  * Book a short meeting with you, your buddy, and the buddy coordinator to give feedback about how the onboarding went in the first month.

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Mentors

The Mentoring system at Lola Tech helps everyone to work with a trusted advisor. Mentors in Lola Tech exist to nurture, support and inspire. "Mentoring is a learning relationship between an experienced person and someone who wants to grow."

Everyone is encouraged to find a mentor. You can either pick someone yourself from the pool of mentor candidates, or ask the Lola Tech matchmaking service to assign you someone.

A mentor - mentee relationship is designed to last for a period of 3 months. After this timeframe, there is a chance to renew.

The suggested time commitment is 1 hour per mentee per 2 weeks. Meetings should be scheduled as far in advance as possible, and take precedence over other work commitments whenever possible.

Matchmaking:
The mentor should be someone with substantial experience in the field the mentee wants to grow in

Suggested intro meeting:

* Share backgrounds to get to know each other
* Discuss what each want to get out of this
* Talk about topics, interests, areas to grow
* Agree on cadence (suggest every fortnight)
* Mentee sends out invite for next meet

Suggested subsequent meeting:

* Key things that happened since last time
* Discuss a challenge that you're facing or a topic that needs attention
* Mentee sends out invite for next meet

Guidance for mentors:

* Suggest limiting the number of mentees to 3 at any time
* You may suggest activities for your mentee to take on between sessions, do this sparingly and be respectful of their time. It is not a mentor's role to set or mark homework.
* Get involved in \`#cop-mentoring\` - this is a skill which you'll need to develop.
* Try to learn something from your mentee

Guidance for mentees:

It is for you to set the agenda, with the guidance of your mentor. Be sure to arrive at each session with a topic in mind for discussion.

How to apply to be a mentor: just post a message in \`#cop-mentoring\` indicating your willingness.

### üë©‚Äçüåæ Scrum Masters

* A scrum master is responsible for the performance of a team, making sure team members can perform to the best of their ability.
* They acknowledge holiday requests in CharlieHR so that they can schedule and adjust project work
* Scrum masters are usually consulted when advocates review performance

### üôã Advocates (formerly known as line managers)

Everyone should have an advocate who officially looks after them. Their main areas of responsibility are:

* Discuss focus and goals
* Review feedback
* Highlight needs, career progression, promotions, salary reviews
* Identify knowledge gaps and arrange training
* Encourage/ monitor use of the mentor system

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Communities of Practice

Lola Tech's Communities of Practice (***CoPs***) are semi-formal groups dedicated to improving our skills and practice in specific areas.

A member of Lola Tech can be part of any number of ***CoPs***, but it expected that everyone plays an active part in at least one. You can ask around for ideas about which ***CoPs*** might interest you, or you can get an idea by searching slack for channels prefixed with `#cop-`.

***CoPs*** are self-organising. They centre around a slack channel and conduct activities such as:

* Chatting in their channel
* Posting interesting links
* Maintaining example codebases
* Maintaining documentation
* Exploring and advocating for new tools and techniques
* Holding meetings and surgeries
* Hosting workshops and presentations
* Running study-group sessions
* Providing one-to-one or small-group training
* Promoting conference attendance
* Lending and circulating books

***CoPs*** can draw on a central budget to fund activities and other costs, which is separate from individual training budgets.

***CoPs*** are encouraged to conduct some of their activity in public as part of the "[Lola Tech & Friends](https://www.meetup.com/lola-tech-and-friends/)" meetup group.

## Practicalities

### ‚è∞ Working Hours

The company runs a flexible schedule regarding working hours. This is so we can service customers who are on different timezones and to ensure everyone can do their job to the best of your ability, and be flexible to cater for personal circumstances and preferences.

Core working hours are 10-4 which means we expect everyone to be working during that period as well as before or after to make up your contracted hours. Any deviation for this should be discussed with your scrum master and/or advocate. Your number of working hours per week is stated in your contract.

*Whether you are working from home or from the office, we don't want your scrum master or anyone else to police your working hours; we expect you do that yourself.*

### üè¢ Working from the Office

Our policy has always been that everyone should be able to work from wherever they are able to do their best work. Our offices are open and you are very welcome to work there.

### üè† Working from Home

When you work from home, you should aim to have a quiet spot wherever possible, so that you can have video calls with a minimum of interruption or distraction.

If your child is sick, it is unlikely that you can get much work done from home. You should consider whether you should take a holiday (unpaid leave is also possible) or make up the time later in the day or the week. We expect honesty and transparency and in return we offer flexibility.

Whilst working from home, it helps to use your Slack status to show when you are away from your desk. If in doubt, always over communicate.

### üíª Working Online

Wherever you're physically located while working you will be making frequent use of online tools. We've learned that it is very helpful to colleagues and collaborators if we all:

* Provide a non-default avatar for services which allow it (e.g. Github, Slack, Jira).
* Default to keeping your camera on during meetings.

It is not the company's intention to police your appearance in any way. The avatar you provide need not be a direct representation, though consistency across platforms is helpful to all. There are many occasions when it is sensible and reasonable to keep your camera off and a break from seeing ourselves is often welcome but visibility, even when you are not the speaker, supports a communicative, welcoming and human workplace.

### Personal Appearance

We do not have a dress code and encourage you to wear what you like. We expect an acceptable level of hygiene and cleanliness. If you're going to have contact with clients or are representing the company at an event, wear appropriate business clothes.

### Personal Details

Keep any change of address, emergency contact or next of kin up to date in CharlieHR.

### üõ†Ô∏è Equipment

üößüöß something about

* ergonomics
* screens and laptops
* Rupert and VladR to flesh out

### üß∞ Tools and Services

üößüöß We use Slack, Zoom, CharlieHR, --> get this from intro email for new starters

### üìã Acceptable Use Policy

üößüöß VladR

## Not Working

Any absence should be requested and tracked in [CharlieHR](https://lolatech.charliehr.com/)

### üèñÔ∏è Holidays

Your annual holiday entitlement is stated in your contract of employment and runs from January 1 - December 31. You should arrange your holidays in advance by requesting them in [CharlieHR](https://lolatech.charliehr.com/).

Every effort will be made to accommodate your individual holiday wishes. As a general rule you should request holiday at least one month in advance per week holiday.

You can carry over maximum 10 unused holidays on the condition it is used within the first 3 months of the new holiday year.

If you leave the company we will balance your remaining holiday (positive or negative) with your final salary payment.

### ü§í Sick Leave

When you are sick, please let your scrum master know asap and log your absence in [CharlieHR](https://lolatech.charliehr.com/). Let us know if you need help.

If you are unwell for more than a week you might need to get a medical certificate stating the reason for the absence, so you can qualify for sick pay.

Clinical appointments: Let your scrum master know about medical appointments (for yourself or your child) in advance so they are aware of your absence. You do not need to give them details about the nature of the appointment. If possible make appointments at a convenient time in your work schedule.

### üë∂ Parental Leave

Becoming a parent is one of the most important moments in your life, whether it be by giving birth, surrogacy, adoption, fostering etc. We want to support you as best we can at this crucial time for you and your family. If anything in these parental leave policies causes complexity for your particular personal circumstances, we are open to all and any possibilities.

If you are becoming a parent (again), let us when when the little one is expected . We will ask about your intention to take parental leave although we realise that this may change later on.

If you or your partner are pregnant, you are entitled to take paid time off work to attend ante-natal appointments.

You should notify the company at least 15 weeks before you intend to start taking your maternity, paternity or adoption leave. Please provide the following:

* The date the child is expected to arrive
* How much leave you wish to take.
* When you intend your leave to start.

Because no arrival is the same, we trust you to take the parental leave in the way that is best for your family.

Throughout the parental (and adoption) leave you are entitled to all your non-pay related contractual benefits.

#### Parental pay (formerly paternity pay)

We provide 2 weeks' leave at full pay, which you can take when you see fit.

Parental pay applies on the arrival of a child where you are either the biological parent or mother's partner

#### Maternity pay

Maternity pay is paid to (future) parents who are pregnant. In Romania, the government covers up to 24 months of fully paid maternity leave and some restrictions apply to when you can start your leave.

#### üó∫Ô∏è Sabbaticals

üößüößüöß Cipri can you dig it up

#### ü´Ç Compassionate Leave

In the event of critical illness or death which affects you, the company will be generous in its considerations of special leave.¬†Let your scrum master or advocate know your plans as soon as you can so they can arrange to cover your absence.

You can take ten days of bereavement leave for the death of a spouse or partner, child or child-in-law, parent or parent-in-law, or sibling or sibling-in-law. You can take three days of bereavement leave for the death of a grandparent, niece or nephew, cousin, or close friend. These caps are not to say you must return to work after so many days; you can use any of your available vacation time if you find you need more time off after bereavement leave. And if you know you'll be away from work for much longer than outlined above, please talk to your advocate to discuss.

Time off for dependants:

All employees are entitled to a reasonable amount of paid time off during working hours in order to take action which is necessary:

* To provide assistance if a dependant falls ill, gives birth or is injured;
* To make arrangements to care for an ill or injured dependant;
* As a result of the death of a dependant;
* Due to unexpected disruption or termination of arrangements for the care of a dependant; or
* To deal with an incident involving a child of the employee which occurs unexpectedly during school time.

The company requires you to give the reason of your absence as soon as is reasonably practical and to indicate how long you expect to be absent. A ‚Äúdependant‚Äù is the partner, child or parent¬†of the employee or any person who lives in the same household of the employee, who reasonably relies on the employee for assistance or to make arrangements for their care.

## Formal Processes

Lola Tech is committed to the highest standards of transparency, integrity and accountability.

### üóØÔ∏è When you need a change from the company

#### Grievance

We encourage an open and honest relationship between the company and its team and we hope that we can resolve any grievance by early discussion with your advocate or other management. When this is not resolved in your opinion, you should address the complaint to whoever you believe best suited from the management team. They will respond with a timeline for action within 24h.

#### ‚úã Whistleblowing policy

An important aspect of accountability and transparency is enabling employees to voice concerns in a responsible and effective manner. Where an individual discovers information which they believe shows serious wrongdoing within the organisation then this information should be disclosed internally without fear of reprisal.

These concerns could include but are not limited to:

* Breach of computer security, confidentiality and data protection;
* Software piracy or other use of unauthorised material;
* Breach of the company‚Äôs own copyright and intellectual property;
* Terms and Conditions of Employment;
* Negative or destructive behaviour, poor attendance, lateness, absenteeism, sickness, impaired work performance;
* Use of or supply of any illegal or controlled drugs at work;
* Failure to comply with a legal obligation;
* Dangers to Health & Safety of the work environment;
* Improper conduct or unethical behaviour;
* Attempts to conceal any of these.

We will treat all such disclosures in a confidential and sensitive manner. The identity of the employee making the allegation may be kept confidential so long as it does not hinder any investigation.

#### Procedure for making a disclosure

All disclosures should be passed to the CEO (Inge) or Business Owner (Luke), whoever is most appropriate in your opinion. They will respond with a timeline for action within 24h.

### üö® When the company requires a change from you

If there is a complaint against you at work, the company will establish the facts surrounding this and no disciplinary action will be taken until the matter has been investigated. If it is not serious, the company will discuss the matter with you suggesting areas for improvement.

If the complaint is serious, the company has the right to suspend you on full pay while they investigate. Suspension during investigation is not a disciplinary action or a prejudgement of the issue. The period of suspension shall be reasonably decided by the company. If the company considers that it is necessary to invoke a formal procedure they will supply a comprehensive written description of the full procedure that will be followed. This can be obtained from management at any time.

**Disciplinary actions**

**If** there is a breach of company policies and disciplinary action is needed, it consists of 4 stages:

**Stage 1 - Oral warning:** if it is a minor breach you will be given a formal oral warning and informed of the consequences and, if appropriate, any improvement required from you and the time frame.

**Stage 2 - Written Warning:** if it is a serious breach or a repetition of a minor breach, you will be given a written warning setting out the precise nature of the offence and future consequences. If appropriate, it will specify any improvement and the time frame required from you.

**Stage 3 - Final Written Warning:** if you fail to improve following a written warning or if the offence, is not gross misconduct although is serious enough in the company's view to warrant a final warning, you will be given a written final warning. This will set out the precise nature of the offence, state that any recurrence may lead to dismissal and specify, if appropriate, the nature of the improvement and the time frame required from you.\
**Stage 4 - Dismissal:** in the case of gross misconduct, or if all previous stages of the warning procedure have been exhausted, the employee will normally be dismissed. The company reserves the right, where reasonable, not to dismiss, but to impose other disciplinary action including (but without limitation) demotion, transfer to another department, loss of seniority, loss of right to a pay increment or bonus or suspension with or without pay.

In relation to gross misconduct, such dismissal shall be without notice or payment in lieu of notice.

**Breaches**

The following are examples of breaches of company policy, which could lead to formal disciplinary action.

**Minor breaches**: unintentional breach of the company's policies and procedures. Poor job performance is also classed as a minor breach.\
**Serious breaches**: abusive behaviour; unauthorised absenteeism; intentional breach of company rules; negligence resulting in minor loss, damage or injury; failure to comply with a lawful and reasonable instruction; irresponsibility in relation to the company's employees or activities; or improper behaviour, whether or not within working hours, which the company reasonably considers to be detrimental to or conflicting with the interests of the company or its employees.\
**Gross misconduct**: negligence resulting in serious loss, damage, or injury; assault or attempted assault; discrimination or harassment, theft; dishonesty; malicious damage to property; wilful disregard of duties or of instructions relating to employment; deliberate and serious breach of confidence relating to the company or the company's business; the misuse of confidential information obtained in the course of the employee's employment; falsification of records; conviction of a criminal charge.

### üí∞ Compensation

Salary reviews happen twice a year (summer and winter).  Pay rises are decided by the management team, approved by the executive team and informed by regular reviews held by advocates. 

Ranges:

L1 - junior:  < ‚Ç¨25k/year
L2 - mid:     ‚Ç¨25k-40k/year
L3 - senior: ‚Ç¨40k-60k/year
