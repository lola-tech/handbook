### 🕸️ The Mesh

The Lola Tech mesh framework is set up to make every staff member feel welcome, supported and encouraged by assigning the following roles:

#### 🤝 Buddies

The Buddies system at Lola Tech helps new colleagues find their feet swiftly and make new connections. It plays an important role in maintaining a happy workplace.

When someone first joins the company they are assigned a Buddy from the existing pool of volunteers. There's no magic to the selection process here but there's a preference for pairings which cross Team and CoP boundaries but which connect folk at comparable stages in their careers.

After that it is just a matter of following the timeline set out below and keeping to the Buddies Contract:

*  Buddies relationship at Lola Tech is reciprocal. 
* An initial Buddy partnership is designed to last for one month. We hope after this time you've got to know each other well enough to continue your relationship.
* Both participants agree to make time for the activities and to take action if something interferes. 
* Scheduled buddy meetings take precedence over other work activities. 
* The Buddy relationship is confidential, a buddy shouldn't pass on anything without explicit consent, nor should either party take any action without prior discussion.

How to be a good buddy - Suggested timeline:

* Before joining:

  * Read your new colleague's CV before they join
  * Have a chat with their interviewer
  * Prepare a welcome message for them in important_all on their first day
  * Check that you'll be working on their first day. Take action if not
* First day:

  * Greet them in important_all first thing in the morning
  * Meet them at the office (if you can) and have a coffee or somesuch, or have a video call with them
  * Make sure you have a slack DM between you so there's an easy open channel
  * Ensure you take them, with anyone else who wants to come, for lunch at your favourite spot. Expense this!
  * Book in a time to chat the next day to discuss anything that's on their mind

#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Communities of Practice

Lola Tech's Communities of Practice (***CoPs***) are semi-formal groups dedicated to improving our skills and practice in specific areas.

A member of Lola Tech can be part of any number of ***CoPs***, but it expected that everyone plays an active part in at least one. You can ask around for ideas about which ***CoPs*** might interest you, or you can get an idea by searching slack for channels which start `#cop-`.

***CoPs*** are self-organising. They centre around a slack channel and conduct activities such as:

* Chatting in their channel
* Posting interesting links
* Maintaining example codebases
* Maintaining documentation
* Exploring and advocating for new tools and techniques
* Holding meetings and surgeries
* Hosting workshops and presentations
* Running study-group sessions
* Providing one-to-one or small-group training
* Promoting conference attendance
* Lending and circulating books

***CoPs*** can draw on a central budget to fund activities and other costs, which is separate from individual training budgets.

***CoPs*** are encouraged to conduct some of their activity in public as part of the "[Lola Tech & Friends](https://www.meetup.com/lola-tech-and-friends/)" meetup group.
