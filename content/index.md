#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Communities of Practice

Lola Tech's Communities of Practice (**_CoPs_**) are semi-formal groups dedicated to improving our skills and practice in specific areas.

A member of Lola Tech can be part of any number of **_CoPs_**, but it expected that everyone plays an active part in at least one.

**_CoPs_** are self-organising. They centre around a slack channel and conduct activities such as:

- Chatting in their channel
- Posting interesting links
- Maintaining example codebases
- Maintaining documentation
- Exploring and advocating for new tools and techniques
- Holding meetings and surgeries
- Hosting workshops and presentations
- Running study-group sessions
- Providing one-to-one or small-group training
- Promoting conference attendance
- Lending and circulating books

**_CoPs_** can draw on a central budget to fund activities and other costs, which is separate from individual training budgets.

**_CoPs_** are encouraged to conduct some of their activity in public as part of the "[Lola Tech & Friends](https://www.meetup.com/lola-tech-and-friends/)" meetup group.
