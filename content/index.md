### üï∏Ô∏è The Mesh

The Lola Tech mesh framework is set up to make every staff member feel welcome, supported and encouraged by assigning the following roles:

#### ü§ù Buddies

The Buddies system at Lola Tech helps new colleagues find their feet swiftly and make new connections. It plays an important role in feeling safe and looked after, and maintaining a happy workplace. #buddies

A buddy provides a friendly face from day one, a place to ask "stupid" questions (spoiler: there aren't any), and helps make joining Lola Tech a great experience.

When someone first joins the company they are assigned a Buddy from the existing pool of volunteers. There's no magic to the selection process here but there's a preference for pairings which cross Team and CoP boundaries but which connect folk at comparable stages in their careers.

After that it is just a matter of following the timeline set out below and keeping to the Buddies Contract:

* Buddies relationship at Lola Tech is reciprocal. 
* An initial Buddy partnership is designed to last for one month. We hope after this time you've got to know each other well enough to continue your relationship.
* Both participants agree to make time for the activities and to take action if something interferes. 
* Scheduled buddy meetings take precedence over other work activities. 
* The Buddy relationship is confidential, a buddy shouldn't pass on anything without explicit consent, nor should either party take any action without prior discussion.

How to be a good buddy - Suggested timeline:

* Before joining:

  * Read your new colleague's CV before they join
  * Have a chat with their interviewer
  * Prepare a welcome message for them in important_all on their first day
  * Check that you'll be working on their first day. Take action if not
* First day:

  * Greet them in important_all first thing in the morning
  * Meet them at the office (if you can) and have a coffee or somesuch, or have a video call with them
  * Make sure you have a slack DM between you so there's an easy open channel
  * Ensure you take them, with anyone else who wants to come, for lunch at your favourite spot. Expense this!
  * Book in a time to chat the next day to discuss anything that's on their mind
* Second day:

  * Have a check in to talk about any questions
  * Make a point of introducing them to two people
* Third day:

  * Book in a short session near the end of their first week. Put it in the calendar. Make it repeat weekly for the next 3 weeks
* End of first week

  * Use the end of week session to focus on practical issues. Commuting, timekeeping, equipment, facilities, expense arrangements etc.
  * Share a favourite tip or trick for making the best of life at Lola Tech
* End of second week

  * Use the end of week session to chat about what you each did at work in the last week
* End of third week

  * Use the end of week session to talk about what still remains mysterious about Lola Tech. Take actions to resolve the mysteries
* End of fourth week

  * Use the end of week session to prepare for a review of the first month with the buddy coordinator (currently Inge)
  * Book Buddy coordinator meeting
* After a month

  * Book a short meeting with you, your buddy, and the buddy coordinator to give feedback about how the onboarding went in the first month.

#### üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Mentors

The Mentoring system at Lola Tech helps everyone to work with a trusted advisor. Mentors in Lola Tech exist to nurture, support and inspire. "Mentoring is a learning relationship between an experienced person and someone who wants to grow."

Everyone is encouraged to find a mentor. You can either pick someone yourself from the pool of mentor candidates, or ask the Lola Tech matchmaking service to assign you someone.

A mentor - mentee relationship is designed to last for a period of 3 months. After this timeframe, there is a chance to renew.

The suggested time commitment is 1 hour per mentee per 2 weeks. Meetings should be scheduled as far in advance as possible, and take precedence over other work commitments whenever possible.

Matchmaking:
The mentor should be someone with substantial experience in the field the mentee wants to grow in

Suggested intro meeting:

* Share backgrounds to get to know each other
* Discuss what each want to get out of this
* Talk about topics, interests, areas to grow
* Agree on cadence (suggest every fortnight)
* Mentee sends out invite for next meet

Suggested subsequent meeting:

* Key things that happened since last time
* Discuss a challenge that you're facing or a topic that needs attention
* Mentee sends out invite for next meet

Guidance for mentors:

* Suggest limiting the number of mentees to 3 at any time
* You may suggest activities for your mentee to take on between sessions, do this sparingly and be respectful of their time. It is not a mentor's role to set or mark homework.
* Take a look at the collection of mentoring resources (link) and consider seeking a mentor of your own, especially if this is new to you.
* Try to learn something from your mentee

Guidance for mentees:

It is for you to set the agenda, with the guidance of your mentor. Be sure to arrive at each session with a topic in mind for discussion.

#### üë©‚Äçüåæ Scrum Masters

#### üôã Advocates

#### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Communities of Practice

Lola Tech's Communities of Practice (***CoPs***) are semi-formal groups dedicated to improving our skills and practice in specific areas.

A member of Lola Tech can be part of any number of ***CoPs***, but it expected that everyone plays an active part in at least one. You can ask around for ideas about which ***CoPs*** might interest you, or you can get an idea by searching slack for channels which start `#cop-`.

***CoPs*** are self-organising. They centre around a slack channel and conduct activities such as:

* Chatting in their channel
* Posting interesting links
* Maintaining example codebases
* Maintaining documentation
* Exploring and advocating for new tools and techniques
* Holding meetings and surgeries
* Hosting workshops and presentations
* Running study-group sessions
* Providing one-to-one or small-group training
* Promoting conference attendance
* Lending and circulating books

***CoPs*** can draw on a central budget to fund activities and other costs, which is separate from individual training budgets.

***CoPs*** are encouraged to conduct some of their activity in public as part of the "[Lola Tech & Friends](https://www.meetup.com/lola-tech-and-friends/)" meetup group.

## Practicalities

### ‚è∞ Working Hours

The company runs a flexible schedule regarding working hours. This is so we can service customers who are on different timezones and to ensure everyone can do their job to the best of your ability, and be flexible to cater for personal circumstances and preferences.

Core working hours are 10-4 which means we expect everyone to be working during that period as well as before or after to make up your contracted hours. Any deviation for this should be discussed with your scrum master and/or advocate.

*Whether you are working from home or from the office, we don't want your scrum master or anyone else to police your working hours; we expect you do that yourself.*

### üè¢ Working from the Office

Our policy has always been that everyone should be able to work from wherever they are able to do their best work.

Our offices are open and you are very welcome to work there. 

### üè† Working from Home

When you work from home, you should aim to have a quiet spot wherever possible, so that you can have video calls with a minimum of interruption or distraction. 

If your child is sick, it is unlikely that you can get much work done from home. You should consider whether you should take a holiday (unpaid leave is also possible) or make up the time later in the day or the week. We expect honesty and transparency and in return we offer flexibility. 

Whilst working from home, it helps to use your Slack status to show when you are away from your desk. If in doubt, always over communicate.

### üíª Working Online

Wherever you're physically located while working you will be making frequent use of online tools. We've learned that it is very helpful to colleagues and collaborators if we all:

* Provide a non-default avatar for services which allow it (e.g. Github, Slack, Jira).
* Default to keeping your camera on during meetings.

It is not the company's intention to police your appearance in any way. The avatar you provide need not be a direct representation, though consistency across platforms is helpful to all. There are many occasions when it is sensible and reasonable to keep your camera off and a break from seeing ourselves is often welcome but visibility, even when you are not the speaker, supports a communicative, welcoming and human workplace.

### üõ†Ô∏è Equipment

### üß∞ Tools and Services

### üìã Acceptable Use Policy

### Not Working

Any absence should be requested and tracked in [CharlieHR](https://lolatech.charliehr.com/)

#### üèñÔ∏è Holidays

Your annual holiday entitlement is stated in your contract of employment and runs from January 1 - December 31. You should arrange your holidays in advance by requesting them in [CharlieHR](https://lolatech.charliehr.com/).

Every effort will be made to accommodate your individual holiday wishes. As a general rule you should request holiday at least one month in advance per week holiday. 

You can carry over maximum 10 unused holidays on the condition it is used within the first 3 months of the new holiday year.

If you leave the company you are expected to use any untaken holiday during your notice period. If that is not possible and/or you still have unused holidays by your final day, you will be entitled to pay in lieu. Similarly, if you have taken more holidays than you have accrued you will be required to repay the company. Any sums owing will normally be deducted from your final salary payment.¬†

#### ü§í Sick Leave

When you are sick, please let your scrum master know asap and log your absence in [CharlieHR](https://lolatech.charliehr.com/). Let us know if you need help.

If you are unwell for more than a week you might need to get a medical certificate stating the reason for the absence, so you can qualify for sick pay.¬†

Clinical appointments: Let your scrum master know about medical appointments (for yourself or your child) in advance so they are aware of your absence. You do not need to give them details about the nature of the appointment. If possible make appointments at a convenient time in your work schedule.¬†

#### üë∂ Parental Leave

Becoming a parent is one of the most important moments in your life, whether it be by giving birth, surrogacy or adoption. We want to support you as best we can at this crucial time for you and your family

If you are becoming a parent (again), let us when when the little one is expected . We will ask about your intention to take parental leave although we realise that this may change later on.

If you or your partner are pregnant, you are entitled to take paid time off work to attend ante-natal appointments. 

You should notify your Team Lead verbally (then follow up in writing) at least 15 weeks before you intend to start taking your maternity, paternity or adoption leave. You are required to provide the following information in writing to the Company:

* The date the child is expected to be (or was) born or adopted.
* How much leave you wish to take.
* When you want your leave to start.

In the case of an adopted child, your notice should also specify the date on which the adopter was notified of having been matched with the child.

In the case of multiple births from the same pregnancy, only one period of leave is available.

The earliest date that maternity pay can start is from the 11th week before the week your baby is due and the latest from the day following the birth.

Paternity Leave can start on any day of the week on or following the child‚Äôs birth or placement for adoption, but it must be completed either within 56 days of the actual date of childbirth or adoption or, if the child is born early, within the period from the actual date of childbirth up to 56 days after the first day of the expected week of childbirth.

Adoption leave can start on the day the child is placed with you for adoption (whether this is earlier or later than expected) or on a date that is up to 14 days before the expected date of placement.

You can change your mind about the date you wish to start your leave but you must give us 28 days‚Äô notice of the change.

Throughout the parental (and adoption) leave you are entitled to all your non-pay related contractual benefits.

#### üó∫Ô∏è Sabbaticals

#### ü™¶ Compassionate Leave

In the event of critical illness or death of a member of your immediate family, the company will be generous in its considerations of special leave.¬†Let your scrum master or advocate know your plans as soon as you can so they can arrange to cover your absence.

You can take ten days of bereavement leave for the death of a spouse or partner, child or child-in-law, parent or parent-in-law, or sibling or sibling-in-law. You can take three days of bereavement leave for the death of a grandparent, niece or nephew, cousin, or close friend. These caps are not to say you must return to work after so many days; you can use any of your available vacation time if you find you need more time off after bereavement leave. And if you know you'll be away from work for much longer than outlined above, please talk to your advocate to discuss that special case.

Time off for dependants:

All employees are entitled to a reasonable amount of paid time off during working hours in order to take action which is necessary:¬†

* To provide assistance if a dependant falls ill, gives birth or is injured;
* To make arrangements to care for an ill or injured dependant;
* As a result of the death of a dependant;
* Due to unexpected disruption or termination of arrangements for the care of a dependant; or
* To deal with an incident involving a child of the employee which occurs unexpectedly during school time.

The company requires you to give the reason of your absence as soon as is reasonably practical and to indicate how long you expect to be absent. A ‚Äúdependant‚Äù is the partner, child or parent¬†of the employee or any person who lives in the same household of the employee, who reasonably relies on the employee for assistance or to make arrangements for their care.
