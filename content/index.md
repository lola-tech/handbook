#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Communities of Practice

Lola Tech's Communities of Practice (***CoPs***) are semi-formal groups dedicated to improving our skills and practice in specific areas.

A member of Lola Tech can be part of any number of ***CoPs***, but it expected that everyone plays an active part in at least one. You can ask around for ideas about which ***CoPs*** might interest you, or you can get an idea by searching slack for channels which start `#cop-`.

***CoPs*** are self-organising. They centre around a slack channel and conduct activities such as:

* Chatting in their channel
* Posting interesting links
* Maintaining example codebases
* Maintaining documentation
* Exploring and advocating for new tools and techniques
* Holding meetings and surgeries
* Hosting workshops and presentations
* Running study-group sessions
* Providing one-to-one or small-group training
* Promoting conference attendance
* Lending and circulating books

***CoPs*** can draw on a central budget to fund activities and other costs, which is separate from individual training budgets.

***CoPs*** are encouraged to conduct some of their activity in public as part of the "[Lola Tech & Friends](https://www.meetup.com/lola-tech-and-friends/)" meetup group.
