## The Company

We are Lola Tech, a software development agency that designs and builds digital solutions to help drive organisations forward. Our focus is on delivering scalable and sustainable products for clients across all industries and sectors. We believe in building software for the future - tech that is flexible, strong and built to
last.

The company was created over 10 years ago by Luke who gathered a few people together he had enjoyed working with, to deliver a large software project. Some of these people were living in Romania. Frustrated by the quality of other external vendors he met, he decided to build an awesome agency team he'd actually like to use. Lola Tech was born. Years later we now have 2 offices, one in Cluj-Napoca and a smaller one in London.

We have written this employee handbook with our core values in mind:

#### Pride:

a sense of responsibility for the quality of work and a sense of achievement driving further results and excellence

The ability to adapt and remain on track long-term, delivering high quality work even when experiencing challenges and difficulties.

Understanding or feeling what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference; the capacity to place oneself in another's position

Nothing in this handbook should supersede rules and laws of the country where this is read.

### üï∏Ô∏è The Mesh

The Lola Tech mesh framework is set up to make every staff member feel welcome, supported and encouraged by assigning the following roles:

### ü§ù Buddies

The Buddies system at Lola Tech helps new colleagues find their feet swiftly and make new connections. It plays an important role in feeling safe and looked after, and maintaining a happy workplace. #buddies

A buddy provides a friendly face from day one, a place to ask "stupid" questions (spoiler: there aren't any), and helps make joining Lola Tech a great experience.

When someone first joins the company they are assigned a Buddy from the existing pool of volunteers. There's no magic to the selection process here but there's a preference for pairings which cross Team and CoP boundaries but which connect folk at comparable stages in their careers.

After that it is just a matter of following the timeline set out below and keeping to the Buddies Contract:

* Buddies relationship at Lola Tech is reciprocal.
* An initial Buddy partnership is designed to last for one month. We hope after this time you've got to know each other well enough to continue your relationship.
* Both participants agree to make time for the activities and to take action if something interferes.
* Scheduled buddy meetings take precedence over other work activities.
* The Buddy relationship is confidential, a buddy shouldn't pass on anything without explicit consent, nor should either party take any action without prior discussion.

**How to be a good buddy - Suggested timeline:**

* Before joining:

  * Read your new colleague's CV before they join
  * Have a chat with their interviewer
  * Prepare a welcome message for them in important_all on their first day
  * Check that you'll be working on their first day. Take action if not
* First day:

  * Greet them in important_all first thing in the morning
  * Meet them at the office (if you can) to have a coffee or do a video call with them. 
  * Make sure you have a slack DM between you so there's an easy open channel. Point out some Slack channels that you think will be helpful to them.
  * Ensure you take them, with anyone else who wants to come, for lunch at your favourite spot. Expense this! If there are other buddies active, team up and go in a group. 
  * Book in a time to chat the next day to discuss anything that's on their mind
* Second day:

  * Have a check in to talk about any questions
  * Make a point of introducing them to two people
* Third day:

  * Book in a short session near the end of their first week. Put it in the calendar. Make it repeat weekly for the next 3 weeks
* End of first week

  * Use the end of week session to focus on practical issues. Commuting, timekeeping, equipment, facilities, expense arrangements etc.
  * Share a favourite tip or trick for making the best of life at Lola Tech
* End of second week

  * Use the end of week session to chat about what you each did at work in the last week
* End of third week

  * Use the end of week session to talk about what still remains mysterious about Lola Tech. Take actions to resolve the mysteries
* End of fourth week

  * Use the end of week session to prepare for a review of the first month with the buddy coordinator (currently Inge)
  * Book Buddy coordinator meeting
* After a month

  * Book a short meeting with you, your buddy, and the buddy coordinator to give feedback about how the onboarding went in the first month.

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Mentors

The Mentoring system at Lola Tech helps everyone to work with a trusted advisor. Mentors in Lola Tech exist to nurture, support and inspire. "Mentoring is a learning relationship between an experienced person and someone who wants to grow."

Everyone is encouraged to find a mentor. You can either pick someone yourself from the pool of mentor candidates, or ask the Lola Tech matchmaking service to assign you someone.

A mentor - mentee relationship is designed to last for a period of 3 months. After this timeframe, there is a chance to renew.

The suggested time commitment is 1 hour per mentee per 2 weeks. Meetings should be scheduled as far in advance as possible, and take precedence over other work commitments whenever possible.

Matchmaking:
The mentor should be someone with substantial experience in the field the mentee wants to grow in

Suggested intro meeting:

* Share backgrounds to get to know each other
* Discuss what each want to get out of this
* Talk about topics, interests, areas to grow
* Agree on cadence (suggest every fortnight)
* Mentee sends out invite for next meet

Suggested subsequent meeting:

* Key things that happened since last time
* Discuss a challenge that you're facing or a topic that needs attention
* Mentee sends out invite for next meet

Guidance for mentors:

* Suggest limiting the number of mentees to 3 at any time
* You may suggest activities for your mentee to take on between sessions, do this sparingly and be respectful of their time. It is not a mentor's role to set or mark homework.
* Get involved in \`#cop-mentoring\` - this is a skill which you'll need to develop.
* Try to learn something from your mentee

Guidance for mentees:

It is for you to set the agenda, with the guidance of your mentor. Be sure to arrive at each session with a topic in mind for discussion.

How to apply to be a mentor: just post a message in \`#cop-mentoring\` indicating your willingness.

### üë©‚Äçüåæ Scrum Masters

* A scrum master is responsible for the performance of a team, making sure team members can perform to the best of their ability.
* They acknowledge holiday requests in CharlieHR so that they can schedule and adjust project work
* Scrum masters are usually consulted when advocates review performance

### üôã Advocates (formerly known as line managers)

Everyone should have an advocate who officially looks after them. Their main areas of responsibility are:

* Discuss focus and goals
* Review feedback
* Highlight needs, career progression, promotions, salary reviews
* Identify knowledge gaps and arrange training
* Encourage/ monitor use of the mentor system

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Communities of Practice

Lola Tech's Communities of Practice (***CoPs***) are semi-formal groups dedicated to improving our skills and practice in specific areas.

A member of Lola Tech can be part of any number of ***CoPs***, but it expected that everyone plays an active part in at least one. You can ask around for ideas about which ***CoPs*** might interest you, or you can get an idea by searching slack for channels prefixed with `#cop-`.

***CoPs*** are self-organising. They centre around a slack channel and conduct activities such as:

* Chatting in their channel
* Posting interesting links
* Maintaining example codebases
* Maintaining documentation
* Exploring and advocating for new tools and techniques
* Holding meetings and surgeries
* Hosting workshops and presentations
* Running study-group sessions
* Providing one-to-one or small-group training
* Promoting conference attendance
* Lending and circulating books

***CoPs*** can draw on a central budget to fund activities and other costs, which is separate from individual training budgets.

***CoPs*** are encouraged to conduct some of their activity in public as part of the "[Lola Tech & Friends](https://www.meetup.com/lola-tech-and-friends/)" meetup group.

## Personal Development

### Conferences

   The budget is ‚Ç¨1.000 per person per year (runs 1 Jan - 31 Dec) and has a limit of 6 working days/year.
The budget covers the tickets, travel, accommodation; timings are discussed with the team member‚Äôs scrum master and whoever is impacted to ensure continuity.
    Please try to decide where you want to go as early as possible to benefit the early-bird prices and also book your Conference/Training time in CharlieHR so that colleagues know you are not reachable.
It is recommended that the maximum number of people attending one conference should not be more than 3 and to be in different teams.

Attending a conference as a speaker or when manning a stand does not count towards your allowance.

### Learning

We strongly believe in a lifetime of learning and self-development, in expanding our technical and soft skills.
Not everyone has the time or the inclination to learn new things in their spare time, so as a software development agency we're making learning a priority. This will allow us to expand our knowledge across different technologies, and remain strong and curious practitioners who are not afraid of any challenge.
 For this reason, Lola Tech is introducing 2 hours of learning during work hours, at the same time and the same day, across the company: Thursdays 1 - 3pm EST.This will be a safe harbour for learning.
You probably already have a clear view of what you‚Äôd like to learn, but if you want help selecting a topic or an objective, reach out to your advocate, or to Vlad Mandiuc - who‚Äôll help you find a mentor. 

 Everyone has their own preferred style of learning, here are a few examples: 

* **learn by yourself** by reading a book, take an online course, follow a tutorial or just apply good ol' trial and error in the pursuit of knowledge. 
* **official or unofficial certifications**. It is not about the certification itself, it is about learning and getting an accreditation in the process. 
* **learn by creating a study group**. Make sure you make it clear what would be the topic and advertise it on the slack channel. Even though it‚Äôs a group, we see no issue with you being the only participant. This is not about teaching a topic, it‚Äôs about learning together.
* **organise a workshop**. We recommend that you advertise it ahead of time. You will need to prepare a workshop and teach others.
* **mentor others or be mentored**. For this you will need to find a pair or group willing to join you. (this is different from the official mentoring sessions that are scheduled outside the learning hours)
* **spread the knowledge of a particular client engagement**. This would not be official work for a client, no technical debts would be resolved here.
* **contribute with content for our organisation**: docs, templates, experimental components, anything that would help others learn better. 
* **contribute to an open source project**.

#### A few rules:

* The company is using a lot of resources to make this time possible. Please don‚Äôt let client-work spill over into this time, and please use the time responsibly to further your personal learning goals.
* To help us understand what folk are focused on so that we can invest more in useful learning support, and to help us justify this considerable investment we‚Äôd like to log the activity.
* Under special circumstances, when something very important and impossible to reschedule would block a team from joining the learning sessions on Thursday, that team (or just the people that are blocked in the team) has the option to choose to conduct the learning in a different day, but at the same hours: 1 - 3pm EST, during the same week. This needs to be agreed in the team and communicated in the learning official slack channel.

#### Logging:

* we will start small and just create a simple Google spreadsheet. In time, we will gather feedback and try to better understand the needs in order to plan an internal tool that will help us better organise our learning sessions. So, if you have ideas or just want to offer feedback, please step forward and help us.
* the minimum log entry is what topic/activity you actually approached during the session.

## üëã Hiring

### ‚åõ Hiring Timeline

The timeline for hiring process starts when the candidate sends us their CV. In the next 72 hours the candidate will be contacted either to be told that we're not going further or to schedule for a technical discussion. After that, in maximum 14 days the candidate will be informed if we‚Äôll proceed with another discussion or the hiring process stops.

üößüößüöß *VladM to add*

### üê£ On-boarding Timeline

The onboarding process starts once the employment offer is accepted.¬†¬†

In the weeks before a new colleague joins us, we will make sure everything, and everyone is prepared and ready to welcome them.¬†

Once the start date is known, Office Manager (currently Ciprian in RO, and Tahlecion in UK) will ensure that:¬†¬†

* The paperwork and contract are ready¬†¬†
* The management team is informed about the new colleague‚Äôs start date¬†¬†

¬†Two weeks before start date, Connection Developer (currently Iulia):¬†

* Creates hardware and user access tickets for Service Desk¬†¬†
* Alerts Capacity meeting to decide the team allocation¬†¬†
* Ensure advocate has background information about the future colleague¬†¬†\
  ¬†One week before start date:¬†¬†
* If new starter is remote only, hardware is delivered to their home by the Helpdesk¬†¬†
* Connection Developer assigns a buddy for the new starter¬†
* The Buddy gathers the information needed about the new joiner 
* Connection Developer works with Advocate to ensure work plan for week one is ready¬†¬†

We believe that a smooth, yet standardised onboarding will help everyone feel part of our team.¬†

We know a first day in a new workplace can be challenging, so we do our best they feel welcome.¬†

Basically, it‚Äôs all about introduction:¬†¬†

* Office Manager/ Connections Developer to welcome to the office, show round or remote welcome¬†¬†
* Helpdesk to provide equipment and a helping hand where needed¬†
* Advocate to introduce team, and first week plan¬†¬†
* Meet assigned Buddy¬†
* New starter gets taken to lunch by Buddy¬†
* IT Security Training¬†¬†
* Welcome call from CEO & CTO are scheduled according to time availability¬†¬†

From the second day, the ramp-up stage begins.¬†¬†

There is no definite ramp-up period because we know that each person is different, has a different level of experience, and each one integrates at their own pace.¬†¬†

What we can promise is that we will be there for you, at every step, and together we will provide guidance, mentorship, and answers to all the questions you may have, in the friendliest and fastest way possible.¬†¬†

## Practicalities

### ‚è∞ Working Hours

The company runs a flexible schedule regarding working hours. This is so we can service customers who are on different timezones and to ensure everyone can do their job to the best of your ability, and be flexible to cater for personal circumstances and preferences.

Core working hours are 10-4 which means we expect everyone to be working during that period as well as before or after to make up your contracted hours which is 40h/week for the vast majority of us. Any deviation for this should be discussed with your scrum master and/or advocate. Your number of working hours per week is stated in your contract.

*Whether you are working from home or from the office, we don't want your scrum master or anyone else to police your working hours; we expect you do that yourself.*

Clinical appointments: Let your scrum master know about medical appointments (for yourself or your child) in advance so they are aware of your absence. You do not need to give them details about the nature of the appointment. If possible make appointments at a convenient time in your work schedule.

**Summer Fridays**

Between June 1st and August 31st,  "Summer Fridays" are in place which means that every Friday we're closing 2 hours before we normally stop work for the week (so 3 or 4pm local time) and start the weekend hopefully in the sunshine. 

Scrum masters will make sure that customer meetings are not scheduled at that time. If you want to book a day off on a Friday then you still need to take the entire day. Hours off are not interchangeable and can not be saved up or otherwise used.

### üè¢ Working from the Office

Our policy has always been that everyone should be able to work from wherever they are able to do their best work. Our offices are open and you are very welcome to work there.

We would like to encourage teams to spend time together in person and to coordinate with each other so that  office days overlap. There's nothing worse than commuting in to be on Zoom all day! Hybrid meetings can be hard so be mindful of this and if possible consider all remote or all in person meetings. 

We want to make sure the office is well set up for collaboration and meetings so if you have any ideas or would like some particular equipment, please talk to us.

### üè† Working from Home

When you work from home, you should aim to have a quiet spot wherever possible, so that you can have video calls with a minimum of interruption or distraction.

If your child is sick, it is unlikely that you can get much work done from home. You should consider whether you should take a holiday (unpaid leave is also possible) or make up the time later in the day or the week. We expect honesty and transparency and in return we offer flexibility.

Whilst working from home, it helps to use your Slack status to show when you are away from your desk. If in doubt, always over communicate.

### üíª Working Online

Wherever you're physically located while working you will be making frequent use of online tools. We've learned that it is very helpful to colleagues and collaborators if we all:

* Provide a non-default avatar for services which allow it (e.g. Github, Slack, Jira).
* Default to keeping your camera on during meetings.

It is not the company's intention to police your appearance in any way. The avatar you provide need not be a direct representation, though consistency across platforms is helpful to all. There are many occasions when it is sensible and reasonable to keep your camera off and a break from seeing ourselves is often welcome but visibility, even when you are not the speaker, supports a communicative, welcoming and human workplace.

### Personal Appearance

We do not have a dress code and encourage you to wear what you like. We expect an acceptable level of hygiene and cleanliness. If you're going to have contact with clients or are representing the company at an event, wear appropriate business clothes.

### Personal Details

Keep any change of address, emergency contact or next of kin up to date in CharlieHR.

### üõ†Ô∏è Equipment

üößüöß something about

* ergonomics
* screens and laptops
* Rupert and VladR to flesh out

### üß∞ Tools and Services

üößüöß We use Slack, Zoom, CharlieHR, --> get this from intro email for new starters

### üìã Acceptable Use Policy

üößüöß VladR

## Not Working

Any absence should be requested and tracked in [CharlieHR](https://lolatech.charliehr.com/)

### üèñÔ∏è Holidays

Your annual holiday entitlement is stated in your contract of employment and runs from January 1 - December 31. You should arrange your holidays in advance by requesting them in [CharlieHR](https://lolatech.charliehr.com/). Public holidays are not included in your entitlement (so you do not have to use a day from your entitlement on a state approved holiday).

Every effort will be made to accommodate your individual holiday wishes. As a general rule you should request holiday at least one month in advance per week holiday.

You can carry over maximum 10 unused holidays on the condition it is used within the first 4 months of the new holiday year.

If you leave the company we will balance your remaining holiday (positive or negative) with your final salary payment.

If a public holiday is not company wide and not in the locality of the customer project you are working on, and it falls on a weekday, you can decide to work that day and take the holiday on another day that calendar month.

### ü§í Sick Leave

When you are sick, please contact your doctor, let your scrum master and office manager know asap and log your absence in¬†[CharlieHR](https://lolatech.charliehr.com/). Let us know if you need help.

### üë∂ Parental Leave

Becoming a parent is one of the most important moments in your life, whether it be by giving birth, surrogacy, adoption, fostering etc. We want to support you as best we can at this crucial time for you and your family. If anything in these parental leave policies causes complexity for your particular personal circumstances, we are open to all and any possibilities.

If you are becoming a parent (again), let us when when the little one is expected . We will ask about your intention to take parental leave although we realise that this may change later on.

If you or your partner are pregnant, you are entitled to take paid time off work to attend ante-natal appointments.

You should notify the company at least 15 weeks before you intend to start taking your maternity, paternity or adoption leave. Please provide the following:

* The date the child is expected to arrive
* How much leave you wish to take.
* When you intend your leave to start.

Because no arrival is the same, we trust you to take the parental leave in the way that is best for your family.

Throughout the parental (and adoption) leave you are entitled to all your non-pay related contractual benefits.

### Parental pay (formerly paternity pay)

We provide 3 weeks' leave at full pay, which you can take when you see fit.

Parental pay applies on the arrival of a child where you are either the biological parent or mother's partner

### Maternity pay

Maternity pay is paid to (future) parents who are pregnant. In Romania, the government covers up to 24 months of fully paid maternity leave and some restrictions apply to when you can start your leave.

### üó∫Ô∏è Sabbaticals

A sabbatical leave is a period in which an employee takes an extended break from work. This is considered an unpaid leave.

Difference from other types of leaves is that it usually lasts longer ‚Äì somewhere between a month to a year, Lola is granting sabbatical to employees who have been with the company for at least 1 year.

### ü´Ç Compassionate Leave

In the event of critical illness or death which affects you, the company will be generous in its considerations of special leave. Let your scrum master or advocate know your plans as soon as you can so they can arrange to cover your absence.

You are entitled to:

* 5 days off for your wedding;
* 2 days off for your child's wedding;
* 5 days off for your child's birth (+ extra 10 days if you did a parenting / Lamase course - only applies to the first child)
* 3 days off for death of a family member - partner/child/parents/brothers/sisters
* 1 day off for death of a family member - grandparents/parents in law

If you know you'll be away from work for much longer than outlined above, please talk to your advocate.

Time off for dependants:

All employees are entitled to a reasonable amount of paid time off during working hours in order to take action which is necessary:

* To provide assistance if a dependant falls ill, gives birth or is injured;
* To make arrangements to care for an ill or injured dependant;
* As a result of the death of a dependant;
* Due to unexpected disruption or termination of arrangements for the care of a dependant; or
* To deal with an incident involving a child of the employee which occurs unexpectedly during school time.

The company requires you to give the reason of your absence as soon as is reasonably practical and to indicate how long you expect to be absent. A ‚Äúdependant‚Äù is the partner, child or parent of the employee or any person who lives in the same household of the employee, who reasonably relies on the employee for assistance or to make arrangements for their care.

Compassionate leave should be logged in CharlieHR as.

## Formal Processes

Lola Tech is committed to the highest standards of transparency, integrity and accountability.

### üóØÔ∏è When you need a change from the company

#### Grievance

We encourage an open and honest relationship between the company and its team and we hope that we can resolve any grievance by early discussion with your advocate or other management. When this is not resolved in your opinion, you should address the complaint to whoever you believe best suited from the management team. They will respond with a timeline for action within 24h.

#### ‚úã Whistleblowing policy

An important aspect of accountability and transparency is enabling employees to voice concerns in a responsible and effective manner. Where an individual discovers information which they believe shows serious wrongdoing within the organisation then this information should be disclosed internally without fear of reprisal.

These concerns could include but are not limited to:

* Breach of computer security, confidentiality and data protection;
* Software piracy or other use of unauthorised material;
* Breach of the company‚Äôs own copyright and intellectual property;
* Terms and Conditions of Employment;
* Negative or destructive behaviour, poor attendance, lateness, absenteeism, sickness, impaired work performance;
* Use of or supply of any illegal or controlled drugs at work;
* Failure to comply with a legal obligation;
* Dangers to Health & Safety of the work environment;
* Improper conduct or unethical behaviour;
* Attempts to conceal any of these.

We will treat all such disclosures in a confidential and sensitive manner. The identity of the employee making the allegation may be kept confidential so long as it does not hinder any investigation.

#### Procedure for making a disclosure

All disclosures should be passed to the MD (Ciprian), CEO (Inge) or Business Owner (Luke), whoever is most appropriate in your opinion. They will respond with a timeline for action within 24h.

### üö® When the company requires a change from you

If there is a complaint against you at work, the company will establish the facts surrounding this and no disciplinary action will be taken until the matter has been investigated. If it is not serious, the company will discuss the matter with you suggesting areas for improvement.

If the complaint is serious, the company has the right to suspend you on full pay while they investigate. Suspension during investigation is not a disciplinary action or a prejudgement of the issue. The period of suspension shall be reasonably decided by the company. If the company considers that it is necessary to invoke a formal procedure they will supply a comprehensive written description of the full procedure that will be followed. This can be obtained from management at any time.

When dealing with a performance issue, we will always strive to avoid a formal disciplinary process if possible. The company focuses on mutual feedback, growth and improvement for every member of the team. If a formal process is needed then the following steps will be followed:

**Disciplinary actions**

If there is a breach of company policies and disciplinary action is needed, it consists of 4 stages:

* **Stage 1 - Oral warning:** if it is a minor breach you will be given a formal oral warning and informed of the consequences and, if appropriate, any improvement required from you and the time frame.
* **Stage 2 - Written Warning:** if it is a serious breach or a repetition of a minor breach, you will be given a written warning setting out the precise nature of the offence and future consequences. If appropriate, it will specify any improvement and the time frame required from you.
* **Stage 3 - Final Written Warning:** if you fail to improve following a written warning or if the offence, is not gross misconduct although is serious enough in the company's view to warrant a final warning, you will be given a written final warning. This will set out the precise nature of the offence, state that any recurrence may lead to dismissal and specify, if appropriate, the nature of the improvement and the time frame required from you.
* **Stage 4 - Dismissal:** in the case of gross misconduct, or if all previous stages of the warning procedure have been exhausted, the employee will normally be dismissed. The company reserves the right, where reasonable, not to dismiss, but to impose other disciplinary action including (but without limitation) demotion, transfer to another department, loss of seniority, loss of right to a pay increment or bonus or suspension with or without pay.

In relation to gross misconduct, such dismissal shall be without notice or payment in lieu of notice.

**Breaches**

The following are examples of breaches of company policy, which could lead to formal disciplinary action.

* **Minor breaches**: Unintentional breach of the company's policies and procedures. Poor job performance is also classed as a minor breach.
* **Serious breaches**: Abusive behaviour; unauthorised absenteeism; intentional breach of company rules; negligence resulting in minor loss, damage or injury; failure to comply with a lawful and reasonable instruction; irresponsibility in relation to the company's employees or activities; or improper behaviour, whether or not within working hours, which the company reasonably considers to be detrimental to or conflicting with the interests of the company or its employees.
* **Gross misconduct**: Negligence resulting in serious loss, damage, or injury; assault or attempted assault; discrimination or harassment, theft; dishonesty; malicious damage to property; wilful disregard of duties or of instructions relating to employment; deliberate and serious breach of confidence relating to the company or the company's business; the misuse of confidential information obtained in the course of the employee's employment; falsification of records; conviction of a criminal charge.

### üí∞ Compensation

Salary reviews happen twice a year (summer and winter).  Pay rises are decided by the management team, approved by the executive team and informed by regular reviews held by advocates. 

Ranges:

L1 - junior:  < ‚Ç¨25k/year
L2 - mid: ‚Ç¨25k-40k/year
L3 - senior: > ‚Ç¨40k/year

## Benefits

Benefits vary per country because of different tax rules, number of employees and availability of certain offerings.

### In Romania:

* Meal vouchers
* Health insurance for the employee and family (partner/kids)
* Sport package
* Extra holiday for each year spent in Lola (max 5)

**Referrals**¬†¬†

If you know someone who you think could be a good fit with the team, either for one of our vacancies or just as an awesome new team member, do not hesitate to have a chat with Ciprian about them. If they get hired, after their notice period, you are eligible for a referral bonus.¬†¬†

* Senior: **1st referral**¬†- ‚Ç¨700; **2nd referral** - ‚Ç¨750; **further referrals -** ‚Ç¨800¬†
* Mid:      **1st referral**¬†- ‚Ç¨450; **2nd referral** - ‚Ç¨550; **further referrals -** ‚Ç¨550¬†
* Junior:  **1st referral**¬†- ‚Ç¨100; **2nd referral** - ‚Ç¨150; **further referrals -** ‚Ç¨200¬†¬†¬†



## Travel and expenses

All travel expenses should be agreed with your advocate or senior managers before booking. The most economic means of travel should be chosen, where practical. Travel between your home and place of work or travel for your own purpose will not be treated as a company travel expense.

**Trains**

We will reimburse the cost of standard class travel on submission of a receipt. First class travel must be pre-authorised.

**Taxis**

Please use public transport where available, unless previously agreed, or it is cost effective due to a significant saving of journey time and you obtain a receipt. When using Uber, use the company account.

**Car**

The company is aware of its responsibilities and liabilities when you are driving a car on company business.
