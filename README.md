# Lola Tech's Handbook

The essential resource for everyone who works at Lola Tech.

## Contributing

While our handbook is viewable by the public, you need to work at Lola Tech to suggest changes. You can do that via a PR against`main` in this repository, or, if you prefer to use a Content Management System, you can head over to <https://handbook-lola-tech.vercel.app/admin.html> where you can log in with any Github user who is a member of <https://github.com/lola-tech>.

## Development

We render our handbook with next.js from MDX sources. This is totally overkill. Most of the heavy lifting is currently to do with generating a useful table of contents, and enabling the use of `next/image` from inside markdown. We pay back many of the worst excesses of using this stack for a single page of straighforward HTML by using an experimental next.js config to omit client-side javasctript on a page-by-page basis.

Currently styling is handled by [pico.css](https://picocss.com/) and as many emojii as we can think of.

The CMS is the amazing [NetlifyCMS](netlifycms.org) - check it out - it stores content in github and uses PRs for editorial workflow ðŸ’–
It runs in production, and on preview branches, where it is connected to a Github OAuth application (which you can manage [here](https://github.com/organizations/lola-tech/settings/applications/1823057)). If you want to try it out locally you can do that too, by running `yarn localcms` alongside `yarn dev`.
